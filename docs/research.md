# Research

[← Docs index](./README.md)

Fusion Research lets you create bounded research runs that search, fetch, and synthesize information from configured providers, then turn structured findings into actionable tasks — all from the dashboard, CLI, or agent sessions.

---

## Overview

A **research run** is a persisted workflow that moves through orchestration phases:

```
planning → searching → fetching → synthesizing → finalizing
```

Each run produces:
- **Findings** — structured results with headings, content, and source citations
- **Citations** — referenced URLs and sources
- **Summary** — synthesized output combining all discovered information
- **Events** — timestamped lifecycle log for auditability

Runs are persisted in the project database and can be listed, searched, exported, and converted into tasks.

## When to use Research

- Explore a technology, library, or API before writing implementation tasks
- Compare approaches (e.g., "SQLite WAL vs rollback journal") with cited sources
- Gather context from web search, GitHub, and local docs in a single structured run
- Let AI agents supplement task planning with real-time information

Research is **not** a replacement for reading source code or local docs — use it when repository-local context is insufficient for the question at hand.

---

## Prerequisites

Research requires provider configuration before runs can execute. If setup is incomplete, the dashboard shows a setup prompt and CLI/agent tools return actionable error codes.

### 1. Enable the feature flag

The Research view is gated behind an experimental feature flag. Set in global settings:

```json
{
  "experimentalFeatures": {
    "researchView": true
  }
}
```

This also reveals the **Research Defaults** and **Research** settings sections in the dashboard Settings modal.

### 2. Configure a web search provider

Set `researchGlobalWebSearchProvider` in global settings to one of the supported backends:

| Provider | Required settings |
|---|---|
| `"searxng"` | `researchGlobalSearxngUrl` — URL of your SearXNG instance |
| `"brave"` | `researchGlobalBraveApiKey` — Brave Search API key |
| `"google"` | `researchGlobalGoogleSearchApiKey` + `researchGlobalGoogleSearchCx` — Google Custom Search credentials |
| `"tavily"` | `researchGlobalTavilyApiKey` — Tavily API key |
| `"none"` | Disables web search (other sources still work) |

API keys are stored through Fusion's auth credential pipeline (`/api/auth/api-key`), not in settings JSON directly.

### 3. (Optional) Enable GitHub research

Set `researchGlobalGitHubEnabled` to `true` to include GitHub as a research source.

Fusion uses the GitHub CLI for this provider, so `gh` must be installed and authenticated with `gh auth login`.

Availability checks for `gh --version` and `gh auth status` are bounded. If either check fails or stalls, the GitHub provider is treated as unavailable instead of blocking a research run or validation suite.

### 4. (Optional) Configure synthesis model

If LLM synthesis is enabled (default: on), set a synthesis provider and model:

```json
{
  "researchGlobalDefaults": {
    "synthesisProvider": "anthropic",
    "synthesisModelId": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
  }
}
```

If no synthesis model is configured, the synthesis phase may fail with a `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` error.

### Settings hierarchy

Research settings resolve through `resolveResearchSettings()` with this precedence:

1. **Project override** (`researchSettings.*`)
2. **Global default** (`researchGlobalDefaults.*`)
3. **Hardcoded fallback defaults**

See [Settings Reference → Research](./settings-reference.md) for the complete key listing.

## Dashboard Usage

### Navigation

The Research view is accessible from:
- **Desktop:** Header → **More views** overflow menu → Research
- **Mobile:** **More** sheet in the mobile navigation bar

Research is intentionally not shown in the primary board/list/agents/missions/chat toggle row.

### Creating a run

1. Open the Research view
2. Enter your query in the text area
3. Select which providers to use (Web Search, Page Fetch, GitHub, Local Docs, LLM Synthesis)
4. Click **Create Run**

The run enters the `queued` status and progresses through orchestration phases as the engine processes it.

### Viewing results

Select a run from the history sidebar to see:
- **Status dot and label** — current run status
- **Summary** — synthesized overview
- **Findings** — individual structured results, each with a heading and content
- **Citations** — linked source URLs
- **Run history** — expandable event log (click "Run history")

### Run lifecycle controls

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cancel** | Requests cancellation for an active run |
| **Retry** | Creates a new retry run from a failed/cancelled/timed-out run |
| **Refresh** | Reloads run data from the server |
| **Export MD** | Downloads results as a Markdown file |
| **Export JSON** | Downloads results as a JSON file |
| **Export HTML** | Downloads results as an HTML file |

### Converting findings to tasks

Each finding has two task-facing actions:

- **Create Task** — Opens a modal to create a new task from the finding, with pre-populated title, description, and priority. The finding content is attached as a task document (key: `research-{runId}`) and optionally as a Markdown attachment.
- **Enrich Task** — Attaches the finding content to an existing task as a document and/or attachment.

### Status indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `queued` | Run created, waiting for engine pickup |
| `running` | Actively executing orchestration phases |
| `cancelling` | Cancellation requested, waiting for graceful shutdown |
| `retry_waiting` | Retry run created, waiting to re-enter the queue |
| `completed` | Run finished successfully with results |
| `failed` | Run encountered an unrecoverable error |
| `cancelled` | Run was cancelled by user |
| `timed_out` | Run exceeded the configured duration limit |
| `retry_exhausted` | All retry attempts exhausted |

---

## CLI Usage

The `fn research` command provides full research run management from the terminal.

### Commands

```bash
# Create a research run
fn research create --query "Compare sqlite WAL vs rollback journal"

# Create and wait for completion (up to 90 seconds)
fn research create --query "Rust async runtime trade-offs" --wait --max-wait-ms 120000

# List recent runs
fn research list
fn research list --status failed --limit 20

# Show run details
fn research show RR-001

# Export run results
fn research export RR-001 --format json --output ./artifacts/research-RR-001.json
fn research export RR-001 --format markdown

# Cancel an active run
fn research cancel RR-001

# Retry a failed run
fn research retry RR-001 --json
```

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `FEATURE_DISABLED` | Research is disabled in settings | Enable project or global research settings |
| `MISSING_CREDENTIALS` | No API key for the configured provider | Add provider credentials in Settings |
| `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | No configured provider or provider down | Configure a search provider |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Provider rate limit hit | Retry after cooldown period |
| `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` | Provider request timed out | Increase timeout or retry |
| `RUN_CANCELLED` | Run was cancelled by user | Retry if needed |
| `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` | All retry attempts used | Create a new run |
| `INVALID_TRANSITION` | Illegal status change | Check current run status |
| `NON_RETRYABLE_PROVIDER_ERROR` | Provider returned a permanent error | Check provider configuration |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected internal error | Check engine logs |

See [CLI Reference → `fn research`](./cli-reference.md) for the full command reference.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/research/search?q=<text>` | Full-text search across runs |
| `GET` | `/research/stats` | Aggregate run counts by status |

### Availability

List and detail endpoints include an `availability` object:

```json
{
  "available": true,
  "supportedProviders": ["web-search", "page-fetch", "github", "local-docs", "llm-synthesis"],
  "supportedExportFormats": ["markdown", "json", "html"]
}
```

When `available` is `false`, the response includes `reason` and `setupInstructions` fields for graceful degradation.

## Agent Integration

AI agents (triage, executor, and custom roles) can use research tools during planning and execution sessions. These tools are registered in the pi extension (`packages/cli/src/extension.ts`).

### Available tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `fn_research_run` | Start a bounded research run. Parameters: `query`, `wait_for_completion`, `max_wait_ms` |
| `fn_research_list` | List recent runs. Parameters: `status`, `limit` |
| `fn_research_get` | Get a run's structured findings. Parameters: `id` |
| `fn_research_cancel` | Cancel an active run. Parameters: `id` |

### Tool responses

All tools return:
- **Text content** — concise human-readable summary
- **Structured details** — machine-readable metadata (`runId`, `status`, `summary`, `findings`, `citations`, `error`, `setup`)

### Availability checks

Before creating runs, `fn_research_run` checks:
1. Research is enabled in settings
2. At least one search provider is configured
3. Required API keys are present

If any check fails, the tool returns an actionable error with setup guidance instead of crashing.

### Best practices for agents

- Use research **only when repository/local context is insufficient** for the question
- Keep queries **narrow and task-scoped** — avoid open-ended exploration
- Persist durable conclusions with `fn_task_document_write` (e.g., `key="research"`)
- Check tool availability before relying on research in automated flows

See [Agents → Research Tools](./agents.md) for more details.

## Architecture

The research subsystem spans four packages:

| Package | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `@fusion/core` | `research-store.ts` | Run CRUD, status transitions, event/source management, exports |
| `@fusion/core` | `research-types.ts` | Type definitions: statuses, events, sources, findings, orchestration |
| `@fusion/core` | `research-settings.ts` | Settings resolution with project/global/fallback hierarchy |
| `@fusion/engine` | `research-orchestrator.ts` | Phase lifecycle management, concurrency control, cancellation |
| `@fusion/engine` | `research-step-runner.ts` | Provider execution: search, fetch, synthesis with timeout/abort |
| `@fusion/engine` | `research/` | Provider implementations and registry |
| `@fusion/dashboard` | `research-routes.ts` | Express router for `/api/research` endpoints |
| `@fusion/dashboard` | `ResearchView.tsx` | Dashboard UI for research runs |
| `@fusion/dashboard` | `ResearchTaskActionModal.tsx` | Create/enrich task modal for findings |
| `@runfusion/fusion` | `commands/research.ts` | CLI subcommands for research management |
| `@runfusion/fusion` | `extension.ts` | Agent tool definitions for research |

### Orchestration phases

```
planning → searching → fetching → synthesizing → finalizing → completed
```

1. **Planning** — Validates configuration and creates an execution plan
2. **Searching** — Queries configured providers for relevant sources
3. **Fetching** — Retrieves full content for discovered sources
4. **Synthesizing** — Runs LLM synthesis over fetched content (configurable rounds)
5. **Finalizing** — Writes structured results (findings, summary, citations)

Each phase emits events (`phase-changed`, `step-started`, `step-completed`, `step-failed`) for real-time progress tracking.

### Concurrency

Runs are processed through an `AgentSemaphore` with configurable `maxConcurrentRuns` (default: 3). The engine processes pending runs from the queue as slots become available.

### Retry behavior

Failed or timed-out runs can be retried. The system tracks:
- **Attempt count** and **max attempts** (default: 3)
- **Root run ID** — chains retries back to the original run
- **Failure class** — determines retryability (`retryable_transient` vs `non_retryable`)

When all retries are exhausted, the run transitions to `retry_exhausted`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| "Research is disabled in settings" | `researchGlobalEnabled` or `researchSettings.enabled` is `false` | Enable in Settings → Research |
| "Research provider is not configured" | No search provider credentials set | Add API key for your chosen provider in Settings |
| "Missing API key for {provider}" | Auth credential not found | Configure provider credentials in Settings → Authentication |
| Run stuck in `queued` | Engine not running or no available concurrency slots | Start the project engine; check `maxConcurrentRuns` |
| GitHub source unavailable | `researchGlobalGitHubEnabled` is off, `gh` is not installed, `gh auth status` is unauthenticated, or the bounded CLI check timed out | Enable the setting, install `gh`, run `gh auth login`, and retry |
| Run times out | Provider slow or `maxDurationMs` too low | Increase timeout in project research settings |
| All retries exhausted | Persistent provider error | Check provider status; create a fresh run |
| Research view not visible in dashboard | Feature flag disabled | Set `experimentalFeatures.researchView` to `true` |
| Settings modal missing Research sections | Feature flag disabled | Enable `researchView` feature flag first |
