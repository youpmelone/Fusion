 *  then AI, then auto-resolve lock/generated/trivial files. They differ only
 *  in the final per-file fallback when conflicts remain:
 *
 *  - "smart-prefer-main" (default): fall back to `-X ours` so main's state
 *    wins. Best when concurrent tasks could regress just-merged sibling work.
 *  - "smart-prefer-branch": fall back to `-X theirs` so the task branch wins.
 *    Best when one agent at a time is dominant and you trust their output.
 *  - "ai-only": run AI on every attempt; never silently prefer one side.
 *  - "abort": run AI once; if conflict remains, fail the merge so a human
 *    can resolve it.

## Prerequisites
First, determine the URL to verify. Check the task PROMPT.md for any URLs mentioned, or look at the code changes to identify the local development server URL (typically http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, http://localhost:8080, etc.).

## Verification Commands
Use these agent-browser commands for verification:
- \`agent-browser open <url>\` — Navigate to the page
- \`agent-browser snapshot -i\` — Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2, etc.)
- \`agent-browser click @e1\` — Click an element
- \`agent-browser fill @e1 "text"\` — Fill an input field
- \`agent-browser get text @e1\` — Get element text content
- \`agent-browser screenshot\` — Capture screenshot to file
- \`agent-browser wait --load networkidle\` — Wait for page to fully load

## Verification Checklist
1. Page loads without JavaScript errors or blank screens
2. Navigation between pages/sections works
3. Forms accept input and submit correctly
4. Interactive elements (buttons, links) respond to clicks
5. Error states are handled gracefully
6. Screenshots capture expected content

## Output Requirements
- If verification succeeds: call task_done() with success status
- If verification fails: describe what failed and how it should behave via task_log()
- Include screenshots as evidence of verification results

Note: Refs (@e1, @e2) are invalidated after page navigation. Re-snapshot after clicking links or form submissions.`,

    toolMode: "readonly",
    prompt: `You are a UX design reviewer. Verify frontend changes maintain visual polish and consistency with existing UI patterns and design tokens.

FAST-BAIL RULE (check this FIRST):
- The task harness gives you a "Diff Scope" listing the files this task actually changed.
- If that list contains NO frontend/UI files (no .tsx/.jsx/.ts/.js component files, no .css/.scss/.sass/.styl, no .html/.vue/.svelte/.astro, no design-token/theme files), respond IMMEDIATELY with a single short line such as "No UI changes in scope — approved." and STOP.
- Do NOT explore the worktree looking for related-looking UI code to critique. If this task didn't change a UI file, your review is a no-op by definition.

Otherwise, restrict your review to the UI files actually present in the diff scope.

Design System Review (only for UI files in the diff scope):
1. **Visual Hierarchy** — Check that the changes maintain consistent heading levels, content flow, and information architecture
2. **Spacing and Typography** — Verify consistent spacing (margins, padding, gaps) and typography scale usage
3. **Color and Token Consistency** — Check that CSS custom properties and design tokens are used correctly; no hardcoded color values that bypass the design system
4. **Component Reuse** — Verify existing UI components are reused instead of creating one-off styling; identify any duplication that could be refactored
5. **Responsive Behavior** — Check that layouts adapt properly across viewport sizes and maintain usability on mobile
6. **Fit with Design Language** — Verify the visual style matches existing patterns (border radius, shadows, transitions, icon style, etc.)

Files to Review (only those that appear in the Diff Scope):
- Modified UI components (React, Vue, Angular, HTML)
- CSS/SCSS/styled-component files
- Design token or theme configuration files

Output Requirements:
- If design is consistent and polished (or there are no UI files in scope): respond with a brief approval line and stop.
- If issues found: start your response with "REQUEST REVISION" and describe each finding with specific file paths and suggested corrections.
- Prioritize issues by impact: layout breaks > visual inconsistency > style preferences.
- Do NOT spend time on stylistic nits when no real issues exist.`,
